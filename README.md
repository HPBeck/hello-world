# hello-world
This is a place where I share ideas and resources.
My name is Hans Peter Beck and I am new to GitHub. I have played around with HTML and CSS for a while on my own and in school without ever becomming confidently good at it. Therefor I have now started a course via Free Code Camp. I'm looking forward to learn how to code properly.
